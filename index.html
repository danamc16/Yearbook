<h1>How do you measure a year in the life?</h1>
And what a year it was.
<br> 
I graduated from high school and finished my freshman year of college. I endured my lowest points while simultaneously having the best time. Never in my life have I been surrounded by so many wonderful friends. Summing up the year in 12 pictures could never be enough.
<h1>..what about <i>love?</i></h1>

		<h1>August '13</h1>
		<p>I dressed up a lot during those first few days, but many memories to be had. We were heading to Silliman Freshman Dinner, and my froco group decided to take a group picture together. They eventually became my best friends at Yale. </p>

			<h1>September '13</h1>
			<p>One of the more memorable trips of first semester, the AACC sponsored a freshman trip to New York City, so I went with one of my best friends, Q. We went to Chinatown and Soho but also visited his high school friend at NYU.</p>

		<h1>October '13</h1>
		<p>My suite decided that we would dominate the Silliman costume contest. So we scavenged cardboard from across campus and after many hours in the art room, pulled together these costumes. We won first place!</p>

		<h1>November '13</h1>
		<p>The classic Harvard-Yale game picture. After partying with the Harvard kids the night before, we piled on a bus to the Yale Bowl. I had to buy a ticket off a scalper and even left the game early, but it was still memorable nevertheless.</p>

		<h1>December '13</h1>
		<p>The best birthday I ever had. The following day I had two finals; I spent most of the day staring at multivariable calculus. My suitemates still organized a party however and got the whole entryway to come. I was so unbelievably happy.</p>

		<h1>January '14</h1>
		<p>On one of the coldest days on record, my best friends from high school and I jumped on a train down to Boston. We danced in the snow-covered Boston Common and gazed at the seals and ice sculptures at the Aquarium, even though we couldn't feel our fingers.</p>

		<h1>February '14</h1>
		<p>My Freshman Screw date was Jacob Neis, a friend from Swing and my co-teacher for Splash. He was the best date anyone could ask for. We partied with both his friends and mine, swing danced amidst the grinding in Commons, and climbed to the top of Vandy to watch the stars.</p>

		<h1>March '14</h1>
		<p>For Spring Break, I did an externship at a startup in Seattle. Work usually didn't start until the afternoon, so I would go sightseeing in the morning. At the insistence of my mother, I stopped by the Chuhuli Museum and saw the most beautiful glasswork I've ever seen.</p>

		<h1>April '14</h1>
		<p>On the last day of classes, we went all out. That afternoon was Holi, an Indian festival where everyone throws colored powder at each other. It was a blast to watch everyone become a mix of oranges, blues, and pinks.</p>

		<h1>May '14</h1>
		<p>I decided to spend my freshman summer in New Haven doing YEI Tech Bootcamp. Much to my surprise, we all piled on a bus and traveled to a ziplining site! Though I'm clearly not going straight in the picture, I bonded quite a bit with everyone!</p>

		<p>The Berkeley Bunch and I got up early and hiked to the top of East Rock, eventually having a picnic there. At Kevin's suggestion, we took the long way and found this beautiful bridge. Photo op!</p>
